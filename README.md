# Code for Robotarium Experiment
This is MATLAB code for implementing the case study in our paper titled "Control Of Mobile Robots Using Barrier Functions Under Temporal Logic Specifications" under review in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO).

This code was uploaded to the Robotarium for implementation on the actual robots. The code in this repository provides a MATLAB simulation of the experiment.

# Instructions for executing Robotarium code

1. Please run the init.m file
2. In the "Code" folder, run main.m to obtain the MATLAB experiment simulation
3. Other functions are defined for each reachability objective

# Instructions for ZCBF prioritization code

1. Please run the main.m file under the ZCBF Prioritization folder.
2. Different weights are included to reproduce the figure in the paper
